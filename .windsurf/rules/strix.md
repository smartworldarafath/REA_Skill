# Strix AI Penetration Testing (Windsurf Rule)

Skill: `strix` — `skills/strix/SKILL.md` / `.agents/skills/strix/SKILL.md`

Autonomous AI penetration testing agent for finding and fixing vulnerabilities in owner-authorized applications and web services.

Rules:
- Only run Strix against targets the user owns or has explicit, written authorization to test.
- Never point Strix at third-party apps, websites, or APIs without authorization.
- Strix is provided "as is"; the user is responsible for compliance with applicable law.
- Feed Strix vulnerability findings into REA skills (web audit, binary disassembly, source recovery) for remediation.
